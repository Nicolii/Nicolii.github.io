# Who the Devil Are You? Rules

## HURDLE

|           |            |
| :-------- | :--------- |
| `1 -  2 ` | Easy       |
| `3 -  4 ` | Average    |
| `5 -  6 ` | Hard       |
| `7 -  8 ` | Very Hard  | 
| `9 - 10+` | Ridiculous | 
| `—————— ` | Impossible |  


## ROLL

Roll a dice according to your skill or ability level:

|        |                    |
| -----: | :----------------- |
| `d4 `  | Poor               |
| `d6 `  | Average (no skill) |
| `d8 `  | Good               |
| `d10 ` | Best               |


### Roll Result

|          |                 |
| -------- | :-------------- |
|   `1`    | Failure, and... | 
|  `Under` | Failure         |
|   `On`   | Almost          |
|  `Over`  | Success         |
| `Double` | Success, and... |


## BOOST

Increase the rolled die

|       |    |       |
| ----: | -- | ----: |
|  `d4` | -> |  `d6` |
|  `d6` | -> |  `d8` |
|  `d8` | -> | `d10` | 
| `d10` | -> | `d12` | 
| `d12` | -> | `d20` |


## HARMONY

Have a equipment or creature (Player or NPC) assist you (Pretty much like assets in Cypher) - Roll an additional die as the same type.  
Can have as many as the GM allows—no hard mechanical limit.


## INJURY

Roll `d10` for each Injury; each `0` rolled on a injury die = an auto-failure.  
Each Success negates an Injury. 5 Injuries require save from death to be unconscious instead.  
Injuries are acquired whenever the GM says so. You can succeed at a task and still receive an injury from it. Some injuries can be avoidable and be rolled against, others not; GM's discretion.
