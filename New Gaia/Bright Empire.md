# Bright Empire
A large continent to the east of New Gaia. The entire continent is ruled by holy empire that worships Solus, the Bright Lord, a deity of the sun. All other religions are declared heretical, and defiers of the Empire are cleansed in the Lords Light (aka burned by divine magic). Their unified, disciplined, and fire magic wielding military makes them a formidable foe for the much less religious (and there for possessing less divine might) Iron Kingdoms when they turned their eyes to their lands, hoping to bring the Light to the entire world.


## Imperial
Originating in the lands taking up the south eastern quarter of the empire are the Imperials. For thousands of years they have been the Bright Empire, but it was only 100 years ago that the entirety of the continent could be said to be under the rule of the empire. Which, of course, then allowed them to set the sights on distant lands, and they began sailing East, to the iron Kingdoms. Imperials are a diverse lot, having incorporated people and cultures from all over the continent but they all have one thing in common, their devout (or at least seemingly) worship of their god Solus, the Bright Lord.


## Mizu (Mizun)
The Mizun live throughout the central wetlands and towering mountains that separate the original Imperial lands and Virtus to the west. Much of the large scale farming in the empire is done within the fertile Mizu lands, their grains fuelling the Imperial machine. The Mountain Lords of Mizu were the first to fall under the banner of the Bright Lord, ages ago when their expansion across the continent began, and exist now as little more than bandit clans hidden deep within the mist shrouded peaks. They still, hold to much of their culture and heritage, but now most worship the Bright Lord rather than the spirits of the water (for which they have nearly 200 different words) their ancestors honoured.


## Virtus (Virtusi)
Virtus is a fertile green land known for its sprawling vineyards and highly sought spices. Their food and drink is highly sought throughout the empire. While the Bright Empire has attempted to outlaw it several times, with rather unfortunate results, it now officially sanctions and monitors the duels fought amongst the particularly rowdy Virtusi youth, usually with the thin but agile blades popular in their culture for it's finesse and beauty in flight. With imperial priests in attendance, death is much less likely of a result, saving more warriors for the Imperial army, and giving them a chance to survey and guide the training of the fierce swordsmen.
