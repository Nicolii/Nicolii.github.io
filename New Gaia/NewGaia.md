# New Gaia
New Gaia, an enormous, rich new land discovered far from [The Bright Empire](https://nicolii.github.io/CypherSystem/NewGaia/BrightEmpire) and the [[Kingdoms]]. A little over 10 years ago this new land was found (no one's really sure which side discovered it first) by both sides, seeking to find a new route from which to assault one another. [The Bright Empire](https://nicolii.github.io/CypherSystem/NewGaia/BrightEmpire), while closer, does not have the advanced sciences or steam engines to power their efforts, and their divine magic, while great for many things, does not build towns. Over the last decade, both sides have begun to build colonies and begin exploring New Gaia, discovering the magical resources, creatures, and peoples that inhabit it.

## The People
All across New Gaia are human tribes, living here for thousands of years, just as infused with the magics of this land as the other creatures that inhabit it. The human tribes of New Gaia, while undeniably human, have greatly changed from their distant relatives from across the sea. They often possess strange, to outlanders, animal like features and adaptations to their environments and lifestyle. A tribe of nomadic hunters that live within the forest may have dappled skin and much taller and more agile bodies. A coastal tribe may have an oily, bluish skin, webbed hands and feet and even a tail and gills. A tribe that lives underground might have colourless skin, elongated ears or other heightened senses. Some have even reported sighting what looked like flying humans high within the mountains.

One thing every tribe seems to share, each in their own way, is a deep connection to the magic of this land. It's use can be seen within almost every level of their culture and lives.


## The Beastfolk
[[Hoofmen]], [[Prariefolk]], [[Koven]], and who knows how many other species of sentient anthropologic peoples live alongside (or in some cases against) the human tribes. Most of the animal folk are no more capable of speaking human tongues than most humans are of being able to speak to a buffalo, but in many cases, the magic of New Gaia has allowed bridging of that gap. Some—especially those smaller in stature—Beastfolk create and use simple tools and weapons, but most are nomadic herbivorous tribes, so those weapons are more often than not to protect themselves from predators. Some larger species, like the [[Bisonfolk]], do not have hands suitable for crafting fine instruments, but their size and strength often makes that a moot point, why create a spear when you can throw a boulder?


## The Oricai
_Eldar tongue:_ **Baun-lek-Tun**
AKA "The Hungry"
The Oricai are a subterranean dwelling tribe of cannibalistic "monsters." Areas near a mountain containing an Oricai horde tend to be highly unsafe at night, for anything that lives and is even remotely edible. Not much is known about the origin of these creatures, and so far any attempt at communication with one has ended in tradgedy for someone, usually multiple people. They, reportedly, can range in size from just around 3 feet tall, looking like small furry bipedal scrawny bears to 12 feet tall with spear like tusks and a hunger unlike any other beast in the known world. If you hear the yips of an Oricai Gob, just hope you don't also hear the earth rattling roar of a hungry ogrin soon after.


## The Flora and Fauna
Animals in this new land are even more diverse than the peoples that live amongst and battle against them. New Gaia is an ecosystem where nature has existed in a magical arms race against itself for thousands of years, the wild places of this powerful and untamed land can be incredibly dangerous, but also wonderous and rewarding to those that will brave it. Man sized bird/feline-like reptilian "copperhawks" of the grasslands, the magical mimicry of the wolvrune, the axe like antlers of the razorhelm, the intelligent flesh eating vines of the southern rain forests, small carnivorous goat like creatures capable of moving fast enough to run across water that hunt by spearing prey with a single crystalline horn, and flowers that mimic large bugs to lure in large birds they then capture and devour. It should also be noted that many of the lands natural inhabitants exhibit supernatural abilities, as if flying creatures capable of carrying off a full grown man weren't bad enough.


## Rumours About the New World
- Some have claimed to have seen creatures of impossible size. After a settlement disappeared in a massive landslide some of the very few crazed survivors claimed that a buffalo with a mountain on it's back had stepped on their village while it walked past, the landslides "came after, from the mountains shaking as it walked by."
- Explorers of the Iron Kingdoms near the settlement of Jokolom claimed to have seen a bird who's wings had to have stretched for miles, and a roiling violent storm trailed along in its path.
- Many "undesirables" from both the Kingdoms and [The Bright Empire](https://nicolii.github.io/CypherSystem/NewGaia/BrightEmpire) have fled to the shores, some of the worst criminals, killers, and heretics have fled their homelands and hidden within this large open space, it is rumoured that most have already been lost to the wilds, and some have been taken and changed by the dark things deep within the forests. Some small homesteads said to have been victim to the predations of the Burned Man.
- Rumours, in both [The Bright Empire](https://nicolii.github.io/CypherSystem/NewGaia/BrightEmpire) and Iron Kingdoms settlements of a horrifically burned sorcerer who commands dark forces has taken up operations all across New Gaia. His agents, when struck down are rumoured to come back to life, possessed by evil spirits or strange magical creatures, or rumoured to have been little more than demons to begin with. There are, the rumours are all in agreement on, that there is some dark entity or group working against both the kingdoms and [The Bright Empire](https://nicolii.github.io/CypherSystem/NewGaia/BrightEmpire) in the new world.
- Ruins and relics, the good old R&R. Archaeologists, treasure hunters, and explorers of all types work to gain passage to the new world for one primary reason. This new land seems to hold a wealth of relics from a long gone civilization, one quite distinct from the few remaining Eldar relics across the sea. Entire cities, meticulously shaped from solid stone, intricate metal work like no one has ever seen, and powerful magically infused artifacts are all there for the study.... and the plunder.
