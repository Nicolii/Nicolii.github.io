# Iron Kingdom
A confederation of independent nations and kingdoms. They were formed over 60 years ago in opposition to the rising threat of Imperial invasion. 10 years later they began their war against the Imperials on the shores of the arid nation of Deshantis.

The Iron Kingdoms have a wide diversity of culture, and are much more scientifically advanced than their religious counterpart.


## Norheim (Norden)
In the frozen northern lands, once disparate warring tribes, now a powerful military kingdom. Their invention of coal engines to power their steel warships, and warrior culture proved a key factor in turning back the Imperial invasion. Their mastery of the sea has made them a prime component in the colonization of New Gaia as well. (these are giant moose riding vikings withiron steam ships and guns lol).


## Orso (Orsi)
To the south east of Nordheim is the land of Orsi. Orsi is a country of sprawling fertile grasslands. They are the leading provided of cattle and horses in the Iron Kingdoms. More importantly, they invented and through a partnership with Nordheim (trading food for iron, and outfitting their warships with canons) produce the majority of firearms as well.


## Atol (Atolian)
Atol is an arid land, in between orso and Bastion. The continent is primarily covered in desert, but the Atolians have learned to live quite well on the inhospitable lands. Their leaders were primarily responsible for the formation and stability of the Iron Alliance, and are well known for being proodigious traders and capable diplomats throughtout all the kingdoms.


## Bastion (Bastionite)
The tropical island nation of Bastion is home to the renowned Academ Bastion, on of the largest and most honoured places of learning in the known world. The people of Bastion are, in large part, renowned scholars, philosophers, scientists, archeologists, and others called to a higher learning. Despite the nations small size, they boast the highest diversity due to the number of people of foreign nations that travel to study, and interact with those that study, there.
