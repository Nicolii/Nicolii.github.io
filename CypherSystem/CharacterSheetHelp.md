# Character Sheet Help

## Task Difficulty

- Task Difficulty represents how difficult a given task is for the average person
- Lowering Task Difficulty through [Skills](https://nicolii.github.io/CypherSystem/CharacterSheetHelp#skills), [Assets](), and [Effort](https://nicolii.github.io/CypherSystem/CharacterSheetHelp#effort) means that the given Task is easier **for you** to accomplish compared to the average person

## Effort

- Amount of times you can apply Effort to a **singular** Task
- Spend points from each appropriate pool to use Effort
- Apply Effort to the Tasks you care about
- Effort Cost = (2 * Level of Effort + 1)
- Think of this as a resource that recharges after every task  
	_Decide to use Effort before rolling for the task, not after_

## [Experience Points (XP)](https://nicolii.github.io/CypherSystem/ExperiencePoints)

- XP like most RPGs is used to advance your character
- But it is also used as a currency for you as the player—outside of your character—to do more
- Examples on the [Experience Points](https://nicolii.github.io/CypherSystem/ExperiencePoints) page

## Stat Pools

- The Might, Speed, and Intellect pools
- These represent fatigue in each field more than as a health resource
- You spend points from your pools as: (Ability Cost + [Effort](https://nicolii.github.io/CypherSystem/CharacterSheetHelp#effort) Cost) - Edge

## Edge

- Your discount to **spending** points from the assigned [Stat Pool](https://nicolii.github.io/CypherSystem/CharacterSheetHelp#stat-pools) **per Action**
- Does not reduce the amount of points **taken** (points that you did not _choose_ to spend)

## Action Cost

- When performing an action that has a cost, you use your [Stat Pools](https://nicolii.github.io/CypherSystem/CharacterSheetHelp#stat-pools) as the resource to pull from 
- Formula for the cost of an action goes  
	(Ability Cost + [Effort](https://nicolii.github.io/CypherSystem/CharacterSheetHelp#effort) Cost + Other) - Edge

## Damage Track

- Your hit points or wounds
- Better represents the state of your characters health than the [Stat Pools](https://nicolii.github.io/CypherSystem/CharacterSheetHelp#stat-pools) do
- You go down one step per depleted [Stat Pool](https://nicolii.github.io/CypherSystem/CharacterSheetHelp#stat-pools)
- There may be other circumstances that bypass [Stat Pool](https://nicolii.github.io/CypherSystem/CharacterSheetHelp#stat-pools) depletion and directly effect your Damage Track such as: a strong poison, or falling from a great height

## Armour

- Reduces incoming damage that does not bypass your specific armour, most commonly Might damage  
	_Armour can be Might, Speed, Intellect armour, as well as fire, electric, interdimensional, etc armour_

## Skills

- Skills make an appropriate, related Task easier (if Trained, or Specialised) or harder (if have Inability)

## Special Abilities

- These allow your character unique capabilities beyond the average person

## Equipment

- Are considered Assets on a task (an axe to help you break down a door, a crowbar to pry something open)
- Try to use to ease your Task using equipment before applying [Effort](https://nicolii.github.io/CypherSystem/CharacterSheetHelp#effort)
- Is also just general equipment

## Cyphers

- One-shot Abilities, can be absurdly powerful. Use them, you will get more
