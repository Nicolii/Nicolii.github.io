# Character Sheet Help

## Task Difficulty

- Task Difficulty represents how difficult a given task is for the average person
- Lowering Task Difficulty through [Skills](https://nicolii.github.io/CypherSystem/CharacterSheetHelp#skills), [Assets](), and [Effort](https://nicolii.github.io/CypherSystem/CharacterSheetHelp#effort) means that the given Task is easier **for you** to accomplish compared to the average person
- You establish the target difficulty before you roll, so all things that contribute to the difficulty **must** be done **before** the roll
- The final number to roll on the dice is the Difficulty number multiplied by 3 that means there are only 6 possible successful numbers to target when rolling the dice

	- 0 ( 0 on the dice) 100% chance of success **is an automatic success**
 	- 1 ( 3 on the dice)  90% chance of success
 	- 2 ( 6 on the dice)  75% chance of success
 	- 3 ( 9 on the dice)  60% chance of success
 	- 4 (12 on the dice)  45% chance of success
	- 5 (15 on the dice)  30% chance of success
 	- 6 (18 on the dice)  15% chance of success
	- 7+ (21 on the dice)  0% chance of success **is an automatic failure**

 		- There are only _really_ four Difficulty numbers you need to remember
	 		- 0 is a guarunteed success
			- 3 is a little bit better than 50% chance of success
	 		- 4 is a little bit worse than 50% chance of success
		  	- 7 is a guarunteed failure

## Effort

- Amount of times you can apply Effort to a **singular** Task
- Spend points from each appropriate [Pool](https://nicolii.github.io/CypherSystem/CharacterSheetHelp#stat-pools) to use Effort
- Apply Effort to the Tasks you care about
- Effort Cost = (2 * Level of Effort + 1)
	- Or first level of Effort costs 3 Pool points, then 2 points for every level of Effort applied thereafter.
- Think of this as a resource that recharges after every task

	_Decide to use Effort before rolling for the task, not after_

## [Experience Points (XP)](https://nicolii.github.io/CypherSystem/ExperiencePoints)

- XP like most RPGs is used to advance your character
- But it is also used as a currency for you as the player—outside of your character—to do more
- Examples on the [Experience Points](https://nicolii.github.io/CypherSystem/ExperiencePoints) page

## Stat Pools

- The Might, Speed, and Intellect pools
- These represent fatigue in each field more than as a health resource
- You spend points from your pools as: (Ability Cost + [Effort](https://nicolii.github.io/CypherSystem/CharacterSheetHelp#effort) Cost) - Edge

## Edge

- Your discount to **spending** points from the assigned [Stat Pool](https://nicolii.github.io/CypherSystem/CharacterSheetHelp#stat-pools) **per Action**
	- This also includes mandatory spends for doing a task
 		- Example: holding open a heavy stone door until someone is able to climb through costing 4 Might
- Does not reduce the amount of points **taken** (points that you did not _choose_ to spend)
	- Example: damage

## Action Cost

- When performing an action that has a cost, you use your [Stat Pools](https://nicolii.github.io/CypherSystem/CharacterSheetHelp#stat-pools) as the resource to pull from 
- Formula for the cost of an action goes  
	(Ability Cost + [Effort](https://nicolii.github.io/CypherSystem/CharacterSheetHelp#effort) Cost + Other) - Edge

## Damage Track

- Your hit points or wounds
- Better represents the state of your characters health than the [Stat Pools](https://nicolii.github.io/CypherSystem/CharacterSheetHelp#stat-pools) do
- You go down one step per depleted [Stat Pool](https://nicolii.github.io/CypherSystem/CharacterSheetHelp#stat-pools)
- There may be other circumstances that bypass [Stat Pool](https://nicolii.github.io/CypherSystem/CharacterSheetHelp#stat-pools) depletion and directly effect your Damage Track
	- Example: a strong poison, or falling from a great height

## Armour

- Reduces incoming damage that does not bypass your specific armour, most commonly Might damage  
	_Armour can be Might, Speed, Intellect armour, as well as fire, electric, interdimensional, etc armour_

## Skills

- Skills make an appropriate, related Task eased (if Trained by 1, or Specialised by 2) or hindered (if have Inability)
- Skills can overlap and both can contribute
	- Example: the broad skill of "stealth" and the narrow skill of "sneaking"
- Skills cannot ease a Task by more than 2 steps

## Special Abilities

- These allow your character unique capabilities beyond the average person

## Equipment

- Are considered Assets on a task (an axe to help you break down a door, a crowbar to pry something open)
- Try to use to ease your Task using equipment before applying [Effort](https://nicolii.github.io/CypherSystem/CharacterSheetHelp#effort)
- Is also just general equipment
- Assets cannot ease a Task by more than 2 steps

## Cyphers

- One-shot Abilities, can be absurdly powerful. Use them, you will get more
