# Experience Points

Experience Points (XP) like many games are used to advance your character's 'power'. But in Cypher it's better to think of XP as advancing your character's narrative. Here's why:

### 1 XP

- Re-roll **any** roll.
- Make a [Player Intrusion](https://nicolii.github.io/CypherSystem/ExperiencePoints#PlayerIntrusion).
- Acquire a Subtle Cypher of a category.
- Refuse a GM Intrusion.

### 2 XP

- Short term / local skill, ability, or equipment.

### 3 XP

- Long term asset such as: NPC contact; home; title or job; wealth.

### 4 XP

- Character Advancement

Every option to spend XP is effecting the narrative of your character to varying degrees, be that a inconsequential stumble (re-roll), 
being able to intimidate anyone in your home suburb (local skill), or becoming stronger or more capable (character advancement)

## Player Intrusion

A Player Intrusion should always involve an aspect of the world beyond the Character, an element of luck outside of the Character's control.  
These can affect a single object (a floorboard snaps), feature (a hidden shallow spot in the stream to ford), NPC (vendor is an old friend), or retcon (hid tools here earlier). But not more.  
A Player Intrusion can’t affect a whole village or even a whole tavern. A rock can come loose, but a Player Intrusion can’t create a landslide.
