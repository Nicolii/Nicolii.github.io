# Experience Points

Experience Points (XP) like many games are used to advance your character's 'power'. But in Cypher it's better to think of XP as advancing your character's narrative. Here's why:

### 1 XP

- Re-roll **any** roll.
- Make a [Player Intrusion](https://nicolii.github.io/CypherSystem/ExperiencePoints#PlayerIntrusion).
- Acquire a Subtle Cypher of a category.
- Refuse a GM Intrusion.

### 2 XP

- Short term / local skill, ability, or equipment.

### 3 XP

- Long term asset such as: NPC contact; home; title or job; wealth.

### 4 XP

- [Character Advancement](https://nicolii.github.io/CypherSystem/ExperiencePoints#CharacterAdvancement)

Every option to spend XP is effecting the narrative of your character to varying degrees, be that a inconsequential stumble (re-roll), 
being able to intimidate anyone in your home suburb (local skill), or becoming stronger or more capable (character advancement)

## Player Intrusion

A Player Intrusion should always involve an aspect of the world beyond the Character, an element of luck outside of the Character's control.  
These can affect a single object (a floorboard snaps), feature (a hidden shallow spot in the stream to ford), NPC (vendor is an old friend), or retcon (hid tools here earlier). But not more.  
A Player Intrusion can’t affect a whole village or even a whole tavern. A rock can come loose, but a Player Intrusion can’t create a landslide.

## Character Advancement

### Increasing Capabilities

You gain 4 new points to add to your stat Pools. You can allocate the points among your Pools however you wish.

### Moving Toward Perfection

You add 1 to your Might Edge, your Speed Edge, or your Intellect Edge (your choice).

### Extra Effort

Your Effort score increases by 1.

### Skills

Choose one skill other than attacks or defense, such as climbing, jumping, persuading, sneaking, or history. You become trained in that skill. You can also choose to be knowledgeable in a certain area of study, such as history or geology. You can even choose a skill based on your character's special abilities. For example, if your character can make an Intellect roll to blast an enemy with mental force, you can become trained in that ability, easing the task of using it.

If you choose a skill that you are already trained in, you become specialized in that skill, easing the task by two steps instead of one. If you choose a skill that you have an inability in, the training and the inability cancel each other out (you aren't eased or hindered in that task). For example, if you have an inability in perception, becoming trained in that cancels out the inability.

### Other Option

Players can also spend 4 XP to purchase other special options. Selecting one of these options counts as purchasing one of the four stages necessary to advance to the next tier. The other three need to be from the other categories. The special options are as follows:

- Reduce the cost for wearing armor. This option lowers the Speed penalty for wearing armor by 1.
- Add 2 to your recovery rolls.
- Select another Focus ability available to you at tier 3. (You must be tier 3 or higher to do this. Characters advancing beyond tier 6 can use this option to select their other tier 6 focus ability.)
- Select another character ability from your Type, such as a tier 2 Warrior selecting Reload or Crushing Blow.
